# OS-Algorithms-Web

We made Operating System Virtual Lab where students are able to learn CPU Scheduling Algorithms from scratch. We have also implemented Algorithms in this website, so students can try out a working algorithm on their own for better learning.

You can see demo from here. [Check Here](https://aditpatel4.github.io/OS-Algorithms-Web/)
